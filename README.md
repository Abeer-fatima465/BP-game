# BP-game
The game starts with a grid of colored balloons. The player selects a balloon to pop; if there is at least one other balloon of the same color “connected” to the selected balloon, the selected balloon does indeed pop along with all other balloons of the same color that are “connected” to it. We will call such a collection a “cluster”.
